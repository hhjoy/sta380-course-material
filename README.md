## Outline of topics  

### (0) The data scientist's toolbox

Good data-curation and data-analysis practices; R; Markdown and RMarkdown; the importance of replicable analyses; version control with Git and Github.

Readings:  
- [a few introductory slides](notes/STA380intro.pdf)
- [Jeff Leek's guide to sharing data](https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing)  
- [Introduction to RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com)  
- [Introduction to GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)    



### (1) Exploratory analysis

Contingency tables; basic plots (scatterplot, boxplot, histogram); lattice plots; basic measures of association (relative risk, odds ratio, correlation, rank correlation)

Some (optional) software walkthroughs: 
- [Survival on the Titanic](https://github.com/jgscott/learnR/blob/master/titanic/titanic.md): summarizing variation in categorical variables  
- [City temperatures](https://github.com/jgscott/learnR/blob/master/citytemps/citytemps.md): measuring and visualizing dispersion in one numerical variable.  
- [Test scores and GPA for UT grads](https://github.com/jgscott/learnR/blob/master/sat/sat.md): association between numerical and categorical variables.  

Readings:  
- [excerpts](notes/DataScience.pdf) from my course notes on data science.  We'll look at some example graphics in Chapter 1.  
- Another interesting (if aesthetically dated) reference is the NIST Handbook, Chapter 1.  
- [Bad graphics ](notes/badgraphics.pdf)  
- Good graphics: scan through some of the New York Times' best [data visualizations](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/21/us/2017-year-in-graphics.html).  Lots of good stuff here but for our purposes, the best things to look at are those in the "Data Visualizations" section, about 60% of the way down the page.  Control-F for "Data Visualization" and you'll find it.  Here are three examples:  
1) [Low-income students in college](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html)  
2) [The French presidential election](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/04/23/world/europe/french-election-results-maps.html)  
3) [LeBron James's playoff scoring record](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/25/sports/basketball/lebron-career-playoff-points-record.html)  


### (2) Foundations of probability  

Basic probability, and some fun examples.  Joint, marginal, and conditional probability.  Law of total probability.  Bayes' rule.  Independence.  

Readings:
- [Chapter 1 of these course notes.](notes/Bertsekas_Tsitsiklis_Introduction_to_probability.pdf).  There's a lot more technical stuff in here, but Chapter 1 really covers the basics.  
- In class, we will look at some pictures and tables [from this packet of course notes](notes/DataScience.pdf).  

Optional but interesting:  
- [Bayes and the search for Air France 447](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.370.2913&rep=rep1&type=pdf).  
- [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9-G-noZrwc) on Bayes and the USS Scorpion.   
<!-- - [Pretty-but-wrong visualization](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/09/14/sunday-review/unplanned-pregnancies.html) by the New York Times on the long-term failure rates of various contraceptive methods, together with [James Trussell's explanation](http://io9.gizmodo.com/what-are-the-real-odds-that-your-birth-control-will-fai-1634707739) of why the 10-year numbers are wrong.  His quote is about halfway down the page.  A great example where assuming independence can lead to trouble!   -->


### (3) Resampling methods

The bootstrap and the permutation test; joint distributions; using the bootstrap to approximate value at risk (VaR). 

Scripts:  
- [gonefishing.R](R/gonefishing.R) and [gonefishing.csv](data/gonefishing.csv)  
- [R walkthrough on Monte Carlo simulation](https://github.com/jgscott/learnR/blob/master/montecarlo/montecarlo_intro.md)  
- [greenbuildings.R](R/greenbuildings.R) and [greenbuildings.csv](data/greenbuildings.csv)  
- [gdpgrowth.R](R/gdpgrowth.R) and [gdpgrowth.csv](data/gdpgrowth.csv)  
- [portfolio.R](R/portfolio.R)  

Readings:  
- ISL Section 5.2 for a basic overview.  
- [These notes](notes/QuantifyingUncertainty.pdf) on bootstrapping and the permutation test.  
- [Section 2 of these notes](notes/decisions_supplement.pdf), on bootstrap resampling.  You can ignore the stuff about utility if you want.  
- [This R walkthrough](https://github.com/jgscott/learnR/blob/master/gonefishing/gonefishing.md) on using the bootstrap to estimate the variability of a sample mean.  
- Any basic explanation of the concept of value at risk (VaR) for a financial portfolio, e.g. [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_at_risk), [here](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/04/092904.asp), or [here](http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/papers/VAR.pdf).


Shalizi (Chapter 6) also has a much lengthier treatment of the bootstrap, should you wish to consult it.    

If time:  
- [An R walkthrough](https://github.com/jgscott/learnR/blob/master/hyptest/hyptest.md) on an introduction to hypothesis testing.
